# EmmaSandu.github.io - Bilingual website

This is a simple website that is currently under construction. 
It serves as an informative platform for readers who are interested in exploring and learning more about my university work. 

## Website’s elements: 

The website’s structural and visual coherence is ensured by:

-	An HTML code that structures the website’s content.
> The HTML code is responsible for organizing and formatting the textual and multimedia elements on the website.

-	A CSS styling that defines the visual representation. 
 > The CSS styling applies design rules such as colours, fonts, layout, and spacing to enhance the overall appearance and user experience.

## Website's composition: 

The website is available in two languages: **English** and **French**. This allows visitors to access the content in their preferred language.

Once completed, readers will find here a collection of my academic projects, research studies, and other educational endeavours. 
Stay tuned for updates as I work on bringing this website to life. 

Thank you for your patience!
