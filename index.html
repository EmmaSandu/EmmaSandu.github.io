    <h1>Hello everyone!</h1>
    <h2> On this website, you are going to find my studies about political changes in Romania. Down below is only an abstract sample.</h2>
    <h3>Social media and politics: the role of Facebook in the rise of new political parties</h3>
<p>Social media’s power to influence elections and governmental policies has made it an essential player in the modern democratic world. Through websites, personal blogs and social media accounts, contemporary politicians build and strengthen their public image, reach different categories of voters and supplement their offline strategies in a cost-effective manner. </p> 
<p> This paper explores whether social media affected the outcome of the parliamentary elections in Romania in 2016, enabling Save Romania Union (USR), a newly formed faction with limited political experience, to become the third favourite option.</p> 

<p> The study examines the public posts on the party’s Facebook page from January to November 2016, taking into account status updates, infographics, photos and videos about their campaign activities or the opponents’ shortcomings. Findings showed that the faction’s digital presence increased its popularity in a short period of time and successfully involved previously uninterested young citizens in political matters.</p>
